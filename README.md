# Dynamic Graph 
Simple project to make a real time graph display using Chart.js and Django.

This project has moved to dynamically update the contents when the user refreshes the page.   
   
### AJAX work is still in progress

To make it work in your system, change the template path in **dynamic_bar_graph/dynamic_bar_graph/settings.py**

#### Python automatically generates a list of 6 integers and make the graph value change over each refresh.
